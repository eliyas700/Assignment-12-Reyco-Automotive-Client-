              What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?
            </AccordionItemButton>
          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
              There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
              your React apps:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="list-disc">
                Local state Global state Server state URL state
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc">Global state</li>
              <li className="list-disc">Server state</li>
              <li className="list-disc">URL state</li>
            </ul>{" "}
            <br /> <br />
            <b>Local (UI) state :</b>Data that we handle in one or more
            components is referred to as local state. The useState hook is most
            commonly used in React to manage local state. <br /> <br />
            <b>Global (UI) state : </b> Data that we handle across several
            components is referred to as global state. When we wish to acquire
            and update data anywhere in our app, or at least across several
            components, we need global state. <br /> <br />
            <b>Server state :</b> Data from an external server that has to be
            combined with our current UI state. Server state is a basic idea,
            but it may be difficult to maintain in conjunction with all of our
            local and global UI state. <br /> <br />
            <b> URL state :</b> Data found on our URLs, such as pathnames and
            query parameters. The category of URL state is sometimes overlooked,
            yet it is an essential one. Many significant aspects of our
            application rely on URL state access in many circumstances. Consider
            how difficult it would be to create a blog without the ability to
            retrieve a post based on its slug or id in the URL!

              How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </AccordionItemButton>
          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
              Simply put, prototype inheritance refers to the ability to access
              properties of one object from another. To extend the functionality
              of an existing object constructor, we use a JavaScript prototype.
              Then we can tell our JS code to inherit properties from the
              prototype. Through the use of a reference pointer function,
              prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse properties or methods
              from one JavaScript object to another.

              Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if
              you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do
              not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts
            </AccordionItemButton>
          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
              One should never update the state directly because of the
              following reasons: If you update it directly, calling the
              setState() afterward may just replace the update you made. When
              you directly update the state, it does not change this.state
              immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and
              accessing it after calling this method will only return the
              present value. You will lose control of the state across all
              components.

              You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price,
              description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products
              by name?

              What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
            </AccordionItemButton>
          </AccordionItemHeading>
          <AccordionItemPanel>
            <p>
              Unit testing's main goal is to isolate written code in order to
              test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
              important step in the development process because, if done
              correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code that would
              otherwise be difficult to find in later stages of testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before deploying code, unit testing ensures that it meets quality
              standards. This ensures a dependable engineering environment that
              prioritizes quality. Unit testing helps developers write better
              code faster and saves time and money throughout the product
              development life cycle.
